### Jellyfin hardlinks for subs and audio in folders
It's very annoying Jellyfin "feature" not to allow use internal folder with subtitles and audio. So script just make hardlinks from internal folder to main video file. Veery helpful for anime and video with multiple audio tracks.

### Usage
Just run script and path like : `python3 jellylinks.py '/path/to/folder'` 

### Tips
You can mix this script with qbittorent external app run after download. Fully automated mode!
